      <summary >"One of my favorite hobbies is tennis. Tennis is a sport where two or four players use rackets to hit a ball over a net and into the opponent's court. The objective is to score points by making the ball land in the opponent’s court in a way that they cannot return it."</summary>
      <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.[1][2]</p>

  <Summary>I enjoy getting lost in the pages of a good book. I love reading fantastic and adventurous stories that take me to magical worlds. Books like "The Hobbit," "Harry Potter," and "The Chronicles of Narnia" are some of my favorites. Reading is a way for me to relax and explore new places, characters, and ideas.</Summary>
  <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images. Modern books are typically in codex format, composed of many pages that are bound together and protected by a cover; they were preceded by several earlier formats, including the scroll and the tablet. The book publishing process is the series of steps involved in their creation and dissemination.</p>
